# To Jump Or Not To Jump


This is the source code for a mini-project written as a part of the course [Wireless Sensor Networks](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/75449/wireless-sensor-networks) offered by Aarhus University Department of Engineering for the spring semester 2021. The goal of the project is to give the students hands-on experience with development of wireless notes. The experience comes from developing protocols and embedded code on the [Contiki-ng OS](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng) on the [Telos-b mote platform](https://www.willow.co.uk/TelosB_Datasheet.pdf).

The topic of this project is to design and develop a relay protocol to determine whether to jump or not to jump to intermediate notes in a network of notes.
The goal is to experiment with the different parts of implementing a relay protocol.
